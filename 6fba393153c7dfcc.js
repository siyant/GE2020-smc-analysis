Singapore's 18th general election was held on 10 July 2020 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic. As a first time voter, I diligently followed the news, had frequent discussions on campaign issues, and stayed up until 4am to watch the results! üò™ 

The day after polling day, while looking at the results on the newspaper, I wondered if any trends could be unearthed from the results. To keep things simple, I decided to look at **Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) only**. Here is my little analysis on the GE2020 results!`

But, wait a minute. 

For the female data, we can see the the top 5 scorers out of the 8 females are from the PAP. Whereas for males, there are 12 opposition and only 9 PAP candidates. So maybe the difference is just due to the PAP candidates pulling up the average for females?

To test this theory, I further split the data by PAP/opposition.`

**‚ùìBut what happened to the earlier 13% gap??**

This is an example of Simpson's paradox! The trend from the combined data disappears when split into more categories, because the categories of data make up different proportions of the total. (You can [read about Simpson's paradox and how 2 opposite arguments can be proven with the same data here](https://towardsdatascience.com/simpsons-paradox-how-to-prove-two-opposite-arguments-using-one-dataset-1c9c917f5ff9)! Really cool stuff.)

In our case, the 13% gap emerged in the total simply because the female candidates are majority PAP and male candidates are majority opposition, and we already know that ~~the PAP always wins~~ a candidate' party greatly influences his/her result.

On a side note, how did Kayla, Gigene and Chen Chen (all 3 female opposition candidates) get virtually the exact same result?! ü§Ø`

Since I started learning more about politics in Singapore, I've been curious about PAP implementing the GRC system "to ensure minority representation in Parliament". If the PAP wants more minority representation in parliament, can't they just achieve that by fielding more minority candidates themselves since PAP is almost sure to win? ü§î If their claim is that it is difficult for minority candidates to win in single seats, then surely this claim can be either backed up or refuted by data.`

Unfortunately, PAP only fielded 1 minority race candidate (Murali Pillai) and in a tough fight against SDP chief Chee Soon Juan. So minority candidates definitely can win single seats, but we can't really draw any conclusions from the single data point.

On the opposition side, the data points are similarly distributed mostly between 26 and 46%. While there is a slight difference in the median vote percentage, it is too small to be significant. On the whole, this chart seems to indicate that Singaporeans do not significantly penalize candidates from minority races in SMC contests.

In any election, much of the outcome depends on unquantifiable factors such as candidates' reputation, publicity and outreach on the ground, as well as the history and sentiments of voters in the constituency. From this small analysis, we only looked at a small number of factors, and found that:

- Voters prefer certain (larger, more established ‚ö°Ô∏èüî®) parties over others
- Candidates' gender and race do not seem to significantly sway the vote 
  - Because of Simpson's paradox, we should split the data into appropriate categories for comparison
- Among PAP candidates, those who have served as MPs previously are able to get higher vote percentages than new faces

Nothing very groundbreaking, but looks like good trends for our society's democratic future! ‚ú®
